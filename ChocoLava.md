#Ingredients:#
 1 cup sugar
 1/2 cup baking cocoa
 1/4 cup cornstarch
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 4 cups whole milk
 2 tablespoons butter
 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
OPTIONAL: Sweetened whipped cream and M&M's

Directions
In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and salt. Gradually add milk. Bring to a boil over medium heat; boil and stir for 2 minutes.
Remove from the heat; stir in butter and vanilla. 
Spoon into individual serving dishes. Chill until serving. If desired, garnish with whipped cream and M&M's.


Puddings and custards can get lumpy. To prevent lumpy pudding, whisk all the dry ingredients together in a saucepan.
 Then gradually add the milk, a little bit at a time, whisking thoroughly after each addition until the mixture is smooth. 
 As you are bringing the mixture to a boil, continue stirring constantly.
 Whole milk lends to this puddingâ€™s desirable thick and creamy texture. If you use anything lighter, the pudding will be thin.
 Also, alternate milks (like soy, almond and coconut) won't thicken properly.
 Lastly,there are plenty of different ways to serve this pudding. We can turn it into a pie! Fill a baked pastry shell with the hot pudding and refrigerate it 
 overnight. Then, top it all off with whipped cream. Enjoy!
